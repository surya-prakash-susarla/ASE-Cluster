## Rules to contribute:
- The `main` branch is protected i.e., no commits can be made directly.
- All commits must be sent as pull requests from feature branches.
- At least one sign-off from a peer (apart from author) is required for merging pull requests.
- Any open conversations/ comments on the pull requests must be resolved before merge is allowed.

## Suggested:
- New branches must be named using the pattern: `name-of-collaborator/feature-branch-name` (ex: surya/create-contribute-md)
